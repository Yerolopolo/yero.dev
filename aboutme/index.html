        <p class="aboutme">Hey! I'm Yero. I'm a 16 year old boy with lots of hobbies (no, seriously, I have too many). I like almost anything related to computers and electronics in general.</p>

        <p class="aboutme">I was born in Spain the 26th February 2007 and since I was a kid I always loved computers, cables and electric things. Combining it with that it was very moved, you can imagine all the bad things I did. <br> When I was 5, I created my first gmail account, <i>tecnico312@gmail.com</i> (I don't have access anymore to that account :sad:) and for me, at that moment, that was my greatest achievement. I remember that at the age of 7, I dissasembled completely my fathers laptop just for fun (yes, I also loved dissasembling things). And still now, I've been experimenting with all kind of electronic things that have arrived to my hands.</p>
        
        <p class="aboutme">Let's start with gaming, one of my main hobbies. I like all kind of games but I mainly play FPS and Driving-sim games such as Valorant, Assetto Corsa or Euro Truck Simulator. Click <a target="_blank" href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/yerolopolo/"> <b>here</b></a> to visit my Steam profile, I always enjoy when people write me comments.</p>
    
        <p class="aboutme">I also like programming, I started with C++ with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.codeblocks.org/">Code::Blocks IDE</a> (You'll be always on my heart) at the age of 6 years, obviously copying the code from random youtube videos but at least I learnt something. <br> Later on, I started learning HTML, CSS and mainly JS with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/soydalto">SoyDalto</a>'s youtube tutorials. I like back-end so JS is my main language. <br> Recently I started learning .Lua because of my <a target="_blank" href="https://superioresrp.com">Roleplay Server</a>. </p>

        <p class="aboutme">One of my most recent hobbies is 3D Printing, I started learning about it at the highscool, there was a Reprap Prusa I3 Hephestos. The machine wasn't very good at all but I learnt a lot from it. Later on, I bought my first printer, a second-handed Anet A8 (which I still have) and a month later my second one, an Anet A8 too. <br>Now I'm more advanced and I print plenty of things. <a href="https://yero.dev/3dprinting/gallery">Here</a> you can see it.</p>
